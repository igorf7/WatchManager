# WatchManager
Version 1.1.1
## Description
A program for interacting with meteo clocks via a radio channel.
A special device is required for interaction.
The device is built on an MSP430F2350 microcontroller and radio module based on SX1211 transceiver.
The radio module can be an RFM63 or DPS1211 board. I used the DPS1211 module in the 868 MHz band.
